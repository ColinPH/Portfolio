                        Tempest Tower is an action packed tower defense platformer where you must brawl with incoming hordes of Creepers while herding the local critters to safety.
                        Build, fight, upgrade, overcome.

                    <strong>Prototyping</strong>
                    <p class="info-description">
                        My first task at Half Past Yellow has been to develop a prototype of their next game, through an internal 2 week game jam.
                        I collaborated closely with the art, design and sound team to quickly build something that would allow to test the vision. 
                        When coding the prototype I focused on fast results to improve iteration times.
                        Creating such a prototype helped identify the development and design challenges ahead of the team, making it possible to play accordingly.

                    <strong>Programming</strong>
                    <p class="info-description">
                        After the prototype introduced me to the inner pipelines of the team, I onboarded the main project Tempest Tower.
                        Being introduced to an existing code base and project was really exciting and motivating.
                        I quickly picked up the conventions and methods to better fit the team's workflow.
                        Navigating new and complex systems wasn't easy at times, but my structured approach allowed me to overcome those challenges and improve my productivity.
                        My contributions focus on the upgrade system, creating new buildable turrets, as well as testing the game and fixing bugs to prepare for release.

                    <strong>Gamescom 2025</strong>
                    <p class="info-description">
                        I have been very fortunate to join the Half Past Yellow team at Gamescom 2025 to showcase the game Tempest Tower to the public.
                        Standing at the booth and welcoming players was awesome and taught me so much about how to present a game and facilitate great play sessions.
                        I was able to draw meaningful observations based on how players reacted to the elements of the game.
                        This experience also taught me the inner workings of participating and showcasing a booth at Gamescom.
