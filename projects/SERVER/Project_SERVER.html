                        A game development server to help me and my team iterate faster and create custom pipelines that better fit our work. 
                        This project has been ongoing and started in March 2024. 
                        This project exists because I wanted to replicate/use/improve some of the tools I saw when working in the industry.
                        Using my own research and experimentation with ChatGPT, I was able to

                        This project exists because I wanted to replicate/use/improve some of the tools I saw when working in the industry.
                        I have always been passionate about work pipelines and how tools and automation could support a team.
                        I see this as my opportunity to learn, practice, explore, refine, test all the pipeline ideas I come up with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started this project with some theoretical knowledge but no practical experience in system administration.
                        This has been a great opportunity to learn using online resources and ChatGPT.
                        My approach with using ChatGPT has been and still is that I make sure I understand what I write before using it. 
                        And I heavily test what I learned to make sure I understand it on a deeper level.

                        Having used laptops, I always wanted to assemble a computer. This was the perfect opportunity. 
                        I used a second-hand motherboard with CPU, RAM and cooler. 
                        Around which I built the other components.

                        The server does not have a GPU installed. 
                        This was deliberate because of energy consumption and due to the fact that the Unity builds I intended to run required only the CPU.
                        I have plans on adding a GPU when project builds require it. 
                        Or when I integrate some automated test that run the executable.

                        The server has multiple drives with each their own responsibility. 
                        An NVME for running the software, an SSD for storing the projects and repos. 
                        And a HDD for storing backups.

                        The server runs a discord bot that informs the team, with some humor, about the state of the automated build and publication.
                        When the message is posted it means that people from the team can download the build from the server.

                        Just like we would see them in the Unity console when building.
                        This has been done so that the programmers can easily see the errors and start working on them without having to fetch them from the server manually.
