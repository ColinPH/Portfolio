                        As the guardian of the lighthouse, reach your rightful place at the top, while traversing and controlling mechanical environments.

                    As a producer, I have found myself providing help to the team whenever, wherever and however possible. 
                    This means that I have done a lot of different tasks which I will describe bellow.

                    <strong>IT Support - Plastic SCM</strong>
                    <p class="info-description">As I was the person in the project with the most experience in using Plastic SCM, I installed and explained to all team members how to use it. 
                        Throughout the project I always helped my team members with solving merge conflicts, and I kept the overview of the creation of branches and merges.</p>

                    <strong>Unity Consultant</strong>
                    <p class="info-description">Given my experience with making games in Unity, I was able to help different people from the team solve the problems they had in Unity. 
                        This ranges from debugging to ensuring the assets were properly imported and located.</p>

                    <strong>Programmer</strong>
                    <p class="info-description">Given my experience in game development, I was able to support the programming department and create QA tools to make testing easier. 
                        I also often provided guidance on how to solve problems in Unity. 
                        I implemented a large part of the sounds for the sound design department. 
                        I created the scene loading system, and I created multiple Editor Tools to help the Art department import assets and create screenshots. 
                        Later in the development phase I also created a script that would build the game with only a single click to make the building process faster.</p>

                    <strong>Ideation Facilitator</strong>
                    <p class="info-description">While in the development phase of the project, I led multiple sessions with my Game Director and Art director to make their visions come together and align.</p>

                <div class="info-item">
                    <strong>Group Cohesion</strong>
                    <p class="info-description">Throughout the project, I did my best to ensure a good cohesion between the team members. 
                        To do this I made sure to always communicate clearly the important pieces of information coming from DADIU officials, I often organized presentation for the team to be informed about the latest decisions from the leads regarding the game. 
                        And I bought food the team each day to facilitate a collective lunch which was very well received and bonded the team even more.</p>

                    <strong>Scoping and Adaptability</strong>
                    <p class="info-description">Throughout this project, I had to rethink my approach to development and planning based on the context of the team. 
                        Rescoping my plans and adapting my approach have been my main focus points to ensure the team was able to create the best game.</p>
